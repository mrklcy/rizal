                    <p>Jos√© Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda was born on June 19, 1861, in Calamba, Laguna. He became the Philippines' foremost national hero not through violent revolution, but through his brilliant mind, compassionate heart, and unwavering dedication to his country's freedom.</p>
                    <p>A polymath of extraordinary talent, Rizal was a physician, novelist, poet, sculptor, painter, educator, and linguist. His novels "Noli Me Tangere" and "El Filibusterismo" exposed the injustices of Spanish colonial rule and awakened the Filipino consciousness.</p>
                    <p>Though he advocated for peaceful reform rather than violent revolution, his writings and ideals inspired the Philippine Revolution and continue to guide the Filipino people today.</p>

                            <p>Republic Act 1425, commonly known as the Rizal Law, was enacted on June 12, 1956. Authored by Senator Claro M. Recto, this legislation mandates all educational institutions in the Philippines to include the study of Jos√© Rizal's life, works, and writings in their curricula.</p>
                            <p>The primary purpose of the Rizal Law is to inspire patriotism and nationalism among Filipino students by exposing them to Rizal's ideals and contributions to Philippine independence. It aims to ensure that future generations continue to appreciate and learn from Rizal's legacy.</p>

                                <li><strong>Section 1:</strong> Requires all schools, colleges, and universities to include in their curricula courses on the life, works, and writings of Jos√© Rizal, particularly his novels "Noli Me Tangere" and "El Filibusterismo."</li>
                                <li><strong>Section 2:</strong> Mandates that all public and private libraries must have adequate copies of these works in their original (Spanish) or translated versions.</li>
                                <li><strong>Section 3:</strong> Authorizes the printing and distribution of Rizal's works by the Board of National Education.</li>
                                <li><strong>Section 4:</strong> Appropriates funds for the implementation of the law.</li>

                            <p>The passage of the Rizal Law was not without controversy. The Catholic Church strongly opposed it, arguing that Rizal's novels contained anti-Catholic sentiments. This opposition led to a compromise where students could be exempted from reading the novels if they or their parents objected on religious grounds.</p>
                            <p>Despite this controversy, the law was successfully passed, reflecting the government's commitment to promoting nationalism and honoring Rizal's contributions to Philippine independence.</p>

                            <p>The Philippines in the 19th century was under Spanish colonial rule, which had been established since the 16th century. The colonial administration was headed by a Governor-General who represented the Spanish Crown and held both civil and military powers.</p>
                            <p>The country was divided into provinces (alcald√≠as) governed by alcaldes mayores, and further subdivided into towns (pueblos) administered by gobernadorcillos, who were usually members of the local elite.</p>
                            <p>This system was characterized by:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Centralized authority in Manila</li>
                                <li>Limited participation of native Filipinos in governance</li>
                                <li>Corruption and abuse of power by Spanish officials</li>
                                <li>Use of forced labor (polo y servicios)</li>
                                <li>Collection of excessive taxes and tributes</li>

                            <p>The social structure in 19th century Philippines was highly stratified, with clear divisions based on race, wealth, and political power:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Peninsulares:</strong> Spanish-born Spaniards who occupied the highest government positions</li>
                                <li><strong>Insulares/Creoles:</strong> Spaniards born in the Philippines who held some government positions but faced discrimination from peninsulares</li>
                                <li><strong>Principal√≠a:</strong> The native elite class that included wealthy landowners and government officials</li>
                                <li><strong>Ilustrados:</strong> The educated class that emerged in the late 19th century, many educated in Europe</li>
                                <li><strong>Mestizos:</strong> People of mixed Spanish-Filipino or Chinese-Filipino ancestry who often engaged in trade and commerce</li>
                                <li><strong>Indios:</strong> The native Filipino majority who worked as farmers, laborers, and servants</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Rizal belonged to the principal√≠a class and later became a prominent ilustrado, which gave him unique insights into both Filipino society and European ideas.</p>

                            <p>The Catholic Church wielded enormous influence in 19th century Philippines, with Spanish friars controlling many aspects of Filipino life:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Friars from various religious orders (Augustinians, Franciscans, Dominicans, Recollects) administered parishes throughout the country</li>
                                <li>They controlled education, with the University of Santo Tomas being the oldest university in Asia</li>
                                <li>Friars owned vast tracts of agricultural land (friar lands), making them powerful landlords</li>
                                <li>They acted as intermediaries between the colonial government and the native population</li>
                                <li>They censored books, newspapers, and other publications</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The abuses of the friars became a central theme in Rizal's novels, particularly in "Noli Me Tangere," where he criticized their moral corruption, exploitation of the natives, and opposition to progress and education.</p>

                            <p>The education system in 19th century Philippines was primarily controlled by the Catholic Church and had several key characteristics:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Primary education was limited and focused on religious instruction</li>
                                <li>Higher education was available mainly to the elite and wealthy families</li>
                                <li>The University of Santo Tomas was the primary institution for higher learning</li>
                                <li>The curriculum emphasized theology, philosophy, and classical studies</li>
                                <li>Scientific and technical education was severely lacking</li>
                                <li>Teaching was conducted primarily in Spanish, which most Filipinos did not speak</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Rizal himself benefited from education at Ateneo Municipal and University of Santo Tomas before pursuing further studies in Europe. His experiences with both Philippine and European education systems informed his advocacy for educational reforms in the Philippines.</p>

                            <h3>Economic Conditions and Trade</h3>
                            <p>The economy of 19th century Philippines underwent significant changes, particularly after the opening of the country to international trade in 1834:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Agriculture was the backbone of the economy, with cash crops like sugar, abaca (Manila hemp), tobacco, and coconut being major exports</li>
                                <li>The galleon trade between Manila and Acapulco ended in 1815, leading to direct trade with Europe and America</li>
                                <li>Foreign merchants, particularly British and American, established businesses in Manila</li>
                                <li>Chinese merchants dominated local retail trade</li>
                                <li>The hacienda system concentrated land ownership among the elite</li>
                                <li>Most Filipinos remained subsistence farmers or tenant farmers (kasama)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>These economic conditions created stark inequalities that Rizal observed and criticized in his writings. His own family experienced economic hardship when they were evicted from their lands in Calamba due to disputes with the Dominican friars who owned the estate.</p>

                                <li><strong>Jesuit Education:</strong> The Jesuits at Ateneo encouraged critical thinking and scientific inquiry</li>
                                <li><strong>Filipino Identity:</strong> Despite his privileged background, Rizal experienced discrimination as a native Filipino, which fostered his sense of national identity</li>
                                <li><strong>Literary Works:</strong> Early exposure to European literature, including works by Cervantes and Alexandre Dumas</li>
                                <li><strong>Martyrdom of GOMBURZA:</strong> The execution of three Filipino priests (Gomez, Burgos, and Zamora) in 1872 for alleged involvement in a mutiny deeply affected Rizal and contributed to his nationalist awakening</li>

                            <p>These early influences laid the foundation for Rizal's later development as a nationalist, reformist, and intellectual leader.</p>

                    <li>Inspired the formation of the Katipunan revolutionary society</li>
                    <li>Became required reading under the Rizal Law (RA 1425)</li>
